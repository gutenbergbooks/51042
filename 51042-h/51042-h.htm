<h1 title="">THE NAKIMU CAVES
<br /><span class="smaller">GLACIER DOMINION PARK, B.C.</span></h1>
<p>Near the summit of the Selkirk range of mountains in
British Columbia is one of the most curious series of subterranean
caves in the world. Being of recent discovery and, up to the
present, almost inaccessible except to the most agile and daring
they remain practically unknown to the world at large, but to
those bold spirits who have dared their black depths they have
offered an experience, weird, thrilling and wonderful. Less
than a thousand visitors at present make the journey to the
Caves each year.</p>
<p>To the graphic description of Arthur O. Wheeler, president
and founder of the Canadian Alpine Club, together with the
report of W. S. Ayres, the mining engineer who was commissioned
by this department to report on the Caves, the substance of
this pamphlet is indebted.</p>
<p>The Dominion Government is at present having work done
which will render accessible to the public this unusual and somewhat
gruesome curiosity. A good road is already built between
the little alplike town of Glacier to within 6,000 feet of the Caves
and a trail connects this point with the entrance. The distance
is about seven miles by saddle pony from the beautiful Canadian
Pacific Railway hotel at Glacier to the end of the road, and the
whole journey can be finished on foot in five hours. The ride
is through scenes almost incomparable, perhaps even in the
Rocky or Selkirk mountains.</p>
<p>The Yoho valley, in which flows the Cougar Creek, in the
bed of which are the Caves, possesses magnificent vistas of
varied mountain scenery. To quote Wheeler:&mdash;&ldquo;It is difficult
to express the wonder of the colour contrasts that meet the eye
in the ever changing panorama of snow-clad peak, rock precipice
dazzling n&eacute;v&eacute;, shining glacier ice and bronze-green forest of
pines, midst which nestle magic lakes of changing shades of
blue and green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler remarks that the Cougar valley, in the bed of
which are the Caves, is of special interest for two reasons other
than the Caves:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;It is of that special type known as &lsquo;a hanging valley,&rsquo;
or one that has been carved out in a U-shaped cross-section by
the action of glacial erosion, and not in the form of a V, as would
have occurred through the action of water erosion alone. It
is, moreover, a very pronounced form of its type. The numerous
small glaciers that still line the sides and head of the valley
give it exceeding great beauty and interest in summer time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>2. &ldquo;I know of no other spot in the Selkirks where alpine
flora is more abundant and varied, and this fact alone is an attraction
not to be despised.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c1">Description of the Valley of the Caves,
<br />by A. O. Wheeler.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The valley of Cougar creek is divided into two parts of
distinctly different characteristics. The upper valley, a great
spoon-shaped basin extending from Lookout point to Cougar
pass, is a most pronounced form of the type known as &lsquo;hanging
valley,&rsquo; or one that has been carved out in a U-shaped cross
section by the eroding power of a glacier at one time filling up
its bottom. This glacier has now shrunk to very small proportions
at the extreme head of the valley. The floor is on a comparatively
low grade and, at one point, is covered for about
half a mile by a small lake-bed in which some water lies during
the summer. The entire length of the upper valley may be put
at 2&frac12; miles. It is inclosed by the rocky steeps of Mount
Bagheera, Catamount peak and Mount Ursus Major, on the
north, and of Cougar mountain on the south. On the sides
of these massives are small glaciers, busy at work tearing down
the entire structures. At the head of the valley, Cougar pass
leads across the shrunken glacier to a steep ravine descending
to the railway at some distance below Ross Peak station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be difficult to find a more beautiful example of
the alpine valley. In every direction silver water-falls leap
down the sides from the glaciers and melting snows of the surrounding
peaks. These collect at the bottom of the valley in
one central stream which bounds in foaming cascades to the
little lake-bed mentioned above. It leaves this, and, continually
augmented by falls from above, rushes through luxurious
meadow-lands in a second series of cascades that have worn
down to bedrock, showing where a thin veneer of soil is overlaying
it. The alpine meadows and park-lands, as well as the
open mountain slopes of the valley, are throughout the spring
and summer decked with a gorgeous array of flowers of varied
hues which, in places, are so profuse and brilliant that it seems
as though nature had spread a carpet of rainbow colours for the
delight and wonder of her visitors. In early spring, the giant
Adder&rsquo;s Tongue (<i>Erythronium gigantium</i>) covers whole acres
with a brilliant yellow. These flowers are the first, and may
be seen pushing their heads up through the snow. Like all
spring flowers in this region, they follow the melting snows,
and may be found higher up in the valley as late as August.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Almost coincident with them is the Globe flower (<i>Trollius laxus</i>),
a plant of much beauty and great wealth of blossom. Next
come the scarlet and crimson Painter&rsquo;s Brush (<i>Castilleia</i>),
showing everywhere in the open and on the lower slopes with
a blaze of glory. Later still, the blue Larkspur (<i>Delphinium
bicolor</i>) and purple and pink Asters replace the earlier series,
the crimson and yellow Monkey-flower (<i>Mimulus</i>) are found in
the beds of the streams and where moisture is prevalent; high
up in the valley and on the alp-lands below the rocks are seen
the False Heaths (<i>Bryanthus</i> and <i>Cassiope</i>) and, highest of all,
the pink-flowering moss (<i>Silene acaulis</i>), found in magnificently
flowered bunches directly below the ice. There are very many
other species more rare, and just as beautiful in blossom, but of
not so frequent or noticeable occurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The timber consists, in this upper valley, chiefly of spruce
and balsam, trees which, at this elevation, in the Selkirks attain
a grace and beauty that is not noticed in the more crowded
areas of lower altitudes. Here they rise symmetrically to a
great height, and their sweeping lower boughs form shaded
canopies that are most inviting during the sultry summer
weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the head of the valley is approached, a short climb
will convey the explorer to the ice of several small glaciers where
he may study with ease their formation and action, look into
miniature crevasses and see how moraines of rock detritus are
formed by the downward flow of the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the site of the Caves, Cougar Creek valley turns from
a northeasterly to a southeasterly direction, and falls sharply
2,000 feet from Lookout point to the tank, as compared with
1,200 feet for the upper valley in the same distance, about two
miles. The lower valley is V-shaped and has, for the most part,
been carved out by the action of water erosion. The sides
except immediately adjacent to the railway are timbered only
in patches and are for the most part covered by closely growing
alders, bracken and rank grass which have replaced the timber
where the slopes have been swept clear by avalanches from the
heights above. Through the latter half of this section of the
valley the stream flows in a narrow canyon and the fall is steep.
As soon as the corner is turned and the slopes of the Illecillewaet
valley reached, a magnificent forest growth of Douglas fir
(<i>Pseudotsuga Douglasii</i>), hemlock (<i>Tsuga Mertensiana</i>), cedar
(<i>Thuga gigantea</i>), and a few scattered trees of white pine (<i>Pinus
strobus</i>) is passed through.</p>

<p class="captionc">Goat Falls&mdash;Near the entrance to the Caves.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;From a natural history point of view, the upper valley
is exceptional, due largely to the absence of visitors in the past.
The Rocky Mountain goat (<i>Haplocerus montanus</i>) may be seen
frequently, and his tracks are everywhere along the heights.
During one of our visits a grizzly bear (<i>Ursus ferox</i>) was killed
by Deutschman. The black bear (<i>Ursus americana</i>) is plentiful
at the head of bear creek across Baloo pass, and it may be safely
assumed that he does not fail to visit Cougar valley. Of the
smaller mammals, the hoary marmot or whistler (<i>Arctomys
Columbianus</i>) is plentiful in both the upper and lower valley,
and is here found in large numbers, larger in size and giving
forth a louder and more shrill whistle than in the main range
of the Rockies. Its startling note is very human and resembles
much the noise that delights the heart of the small boy, produced
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
by placing the fingers between the lips. Say&rsquo;s squirrel (<i>Spermophilus
lateralis</i>) and Parry&rsquo;s marmot (<i>Spermophilus Parryi</i>)
are also found, the latter in great numbers. The Little Chief
hare (<i>Logomys princeps</i>) is frequently seen disporting itself
among the rocks, and its comical antics and quaint squeak,
resembling that of a toy rabbit, are very amusing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The birds are few, and in the upper valley are chiefly
confined to the Ptarmigan (<i>Lagopus leucurus</i>), of which a flock
may nearly always be seen, the water ousel or dipper (<i>Cinclus
Mexicanus</i>), a funny little dark grey chap who flits from stone
to stone along the cascades and falls of the valley, continually
bobbing and dipping as though it were the object and aim of
his existence. This bird has a very sweet note. Of other birds
the black-headed jay (<i>Cyanocitta stelleri annectens</i>) and the
Rocky Mountain Whisky Jack (<i>Perisoreus Canadensis capitalis</i>)
are the most apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken as a whole, this wonderful valley is worthy of a
visit quite independently of the attractions offered by the
Caves, and it would be difficult to find a more representative or
better type of valley to illustrate the various phases of nature
in the Selkirks&mdash;scenery, geology, natural history and botany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the year 1904 that Charles Henry Deutschman
of Revelstoke, a British subject, while prospecting and hunting
big game, discovered the Caves in series.</p>
<p>The next person to enter the Caves after Deutschman was
A. Johnston, editor of the Revelstoke <i>Mail-Herald</i>. Next, in
May, 1905, a party of twelve persons, including W. S. Ayres,
the mining engineer, Howard Douglas, superintendent of Rocky
Mountains Park, and R. B. Bennett, the Associated Press
correspondent at Vancouver and now member of the Dominion
House representing Calgary, visited the Caves. Most of this
party, however, returned to Glacier on the following day and
left Messrs. Ayres, Deutschman, Johnston, Benson and Field
to make further explorations.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c2">Mr. Ayres&rsquo; Description of this Exploration.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;On the morning of May 30, the entire party entered the
cave by the opening which I have designated on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as
&lsquo;Entrance No. 1.&rsquo; Pools of water more or less filled with ice
were encountered, which greatly impeded our progress, and
finally a very deep one, at a distance of 237 feet from the surface,
barred further progress until a raft could be prepared. Retracing
our steps to the surface we sought an entrance in &lsquo;The
Canyon&rsquo; by means of a rope. This passage was about 70 feet
below the natural surface and about 100 feet above the bottom
of &lsquo;The Canyon,&rsquo; was very small and blocked with ice. I have
designated this opening as &lsquo;Entrance No. 2,&rsquo; on the <a href="#map1">map</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another opening was found which is recorded as &lsquo;Entrance
No. 3.&rsquo; Here, by crawling through a very narrow passage on
hands and knees and then descending a steep narrow water
groove for about 50 feet the brink of a very large cavern was
reached that was estimated to be 256 feet deep, but its length
and breadth were, owing to their great extent and to the insufficiency
of lights at hand, inaccessible. It was observable,
however, that several openings led off from this great cavern.
The plunge and roar of a great waterfall somewhere down in
the depths of this cavern reverberates in every inch of space,
and produces in the listener sensations so weird that even those
that have elsewhere met its counterpart are at first startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No further attempt was made at this time to explore the
cave through this entrance for the reason that the three hundred
feet of rope sent by Mr. Ford, resident engineer of the C.P.R.,
for our use, had not yet been brought up to the cave from the
water tank. On the following day another obstacle presented
itself. The rapidly melting snow formed a sudden rush of water
which poured down the mountain side and into this opening,
and made it not only inaccessible for the time being, but proved
it to be positively dangerous to enter for any extended explorations
until the snow has practically disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the afternoon of May 31, and the forenoon of June 1,
a raft and additional ladders were constructed to cross over the
large pool that impeded our progress on May 30 in &lsquo;Entrance
No. 1.&rsquo; While we were eating our noon meal on the 31st,
Cougar creek overflowed into this entrance. We made the
attempt to descend but were drenched with water, and our lights
were put out. We constructed a dam to prevent this, as far as
possible, and at 6 a.m. on June 2 we again descended into the cave
by this entrance, and found at a distance of 331 feet from the
surface a large square chamber, 50 feet wide by 60 feet, that
was accessible. A large portion of its length was inaccessible
owing to Cougar creek, which flows across it, and to accumulated
ice. We named this chamber &lsquo;The Auditorium.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a point in the main entrance just as we emerge from
&lsquo;The Auditorium,&rsquo; a branch passage was found which again joins
the main entrance about 100 feet from the surface. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
branch passage is marked on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as A-B. Another branch
passage was found to connect this entrance with the surface
and it is designated on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as B-C. A diligent search in
this part of the cave disclosed no other accessible openings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A descent by ropes to the bottom of the canyon at &lsquo;Entrance
No. 2&rsquo; was considered but it was deemed entirely unsafe,
owing to the very large accumulated mass of snow which might
slide into it at any moment, and without warning. Besides
this, no entry can be made until Cougar creek has subsided to
a mere brook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The falls, designated on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as &lsquo;Lower Goat Falls,&rsquo;
were visited with the hope that an entrance might be effected
to the very large cavern by the passage through which the water
from the fall enters; but it was practically filled with water and
ice. The falls consist of two vertical drops, the upper one is
about 30 feet and the lower one 50 feet. A large amount of
water is delivered into the cave from these falls, the place of
entry being immediately at its foot. It is called &lsquo;Entrance
No. 4.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other openings were discovered by which access might
be had to the large cavern, and we are barred from entering it
by those openings already described, and for the reasons given,
until such time as the spring floods may have fully subsided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. A. O. Wheeler, D.L.S., accompanied by Deutschman,
was the next explorer, and the following is Mr. Wheeler&rsquo;s description
of their experiences in the new caves which were discovered
during this visit:&mdash;</p>
<h3 id="c3">Mr. Wheeler&rsquo;s Exploration and Description of the Caves.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Up to this time, only the Gopher Bridge series and the
Mill Bridge series (see <a href="#map1">map</a>) had been explored. It was not
until a day or two before the close of the survey, August 4, that
an attempt was made to penetrate the huge opening seen at the
north end of the bottom of the gorge. On the date named, the
writer descended by means of a knotted rope, and was followed
by Deutschman. The stream was then at high water, and
pouring into the opening with a tremendous rush and swirl of
waters. Although the creek was crossed by wading waist deep
in the icy torrent, it was found impossible to penetrate more
than a couple of hundred feet into the depth. Later in the month
Deutschman, alone and unaided, penetrated this opening and
worked his way across the stream, discovering what is now
referred to as the Gorge series, or the series of passageways
reached by the opening from the Gorge. And here the writer
begs to say a word or two concerning this remarkable man. The
work of exploration he has done without assistance, shows a
character utterly devoid of fear. The descent into depths of
blackest darkness, lighted only by the dim rays of a tallow dip,
without a rope or other aid except in a case of direst necessity,
requires more than courage; it requires strength of purpose and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
power of will far beyond the ordinary degree. For, added to
the thick darkness, there was always the fierce vibrating roar
of subterranean torrents, a sound most nerve shaking in a position
sufficiently uncanny and demoralizing without it. Huge cracks
had to be crossed, and precipitous descents made in pitch darkness,
where, it is safe to say, a misstep would have instant death,
either suddenly or through disablement. Now that ladders are
placed and ropes set, and the sure path pointed out by this
intrepid guide, it is difficult to realize how in the first place
the passage could possibly have been made without.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first visitor after Deutschman to the Gorge series was
a Mr. Lang, of Golden, B.C., who very nearly met with a serious
accident when climbing up the rope from the bottom of the gorge
to the floor of the valley, 80 feet above. He had nearly reached
the top when his strength gave out, and he slid back down the
rope, arriving at the bottom in a much bruised condition, but
fortunately with no bones broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler furnishes a splendid detail description of the
various series of caves, and it is thought well to reproduce this
description <i>in extenso</i>:&mdash;</p>
<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">Gopher Bridge Series.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;On leaving the lake-bed above mentioned, Cougar creek
flows in a series of cascades for a little more than half a mile
through open alpine meadowland, broken here and there by
knolls crowned with scrubby spruce. Suddenly, without warning,
it drops into a cavity and, 450 feet farther down, quietly issues
from its underground way. During this disappearance the
stream has only dropped 30 feet. The intervening space
between the entry into and exit from the ground has been named
&lsquo;Gopher Bridge&rsquo; by the first party visiting the Caves, owing to
the large numbers of Parry&rsquo;s marmot, which much resembles a
gopher, to be seen in the immediate vicinity, and the underlying
passages are here referred to as the Gopher Bridge series. Directly
opposite the disappearance of the creek, two striking cascades
tumble down the mountain side and uniting, flow for a short
space parallel to Cougar creek; then, vanishing into a hole in
the ground, they join the main stream by a subterranean passage.
They are known as &lsquo;Gopher Falls,&rsquo; and the place where they
disappear as the &lsquo;Gopher Hole&rsquo; (see <a href="#map1">map</a> of Caves).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gopher Bridge series of passageways was at first
entered by the opening shown on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as &lsquo;Old Entrance.&rsquo;
It was a very disagreeable operation, entailing much wriggling
and squeezing through narrow cracks over dirty rocks. Eventually,
a point of vantage was reached directly over the subterranean
torrent. At the time of the first exploration the
writer took acetylene bicycle lamps, whose bull&rsquo;s-eyes enabled
the pitch darkness to be pierced to some extent. Magnesium
wire also was lighted, and, by its aid, for a brief minute, the interior
was bathed in dazzling brightness. Standing on a narrow
ledge that overhangs a black abyss, the eye is first drawn by a
subterranean waterfall heard roaring immediately on the left.
It appears to pour from a dark opening above it. Below,
between black walls of rock, may be seen the foam-flecked
torrent hurtling down the incline until lost in sense shadows.
Overhead, fantastic spurs and shapes reach out into the blackness
and the entire surroundings are so weird and uncanny that it is
easy to imagine Dante seated upon one of these spurs deriving
impressions for his inferno. As the brilliant light goes out the
thick darkness makes itself felt, and instinctively you feel to
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
see if Charon is not standing beside you. This subterranean
stream, with its unearthly surroundings, is somewhat suggestive
of the Styx, and incidentally supplied the name &lsquo;Avernus&rsquo; for
the cavern of the waterfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time the stream entered by this opening, but a
natural dam has gradually been formed causing it to find a new
opening at the spot where it is now shown disappearing on the
<a href="#map1">map</a>. About midway between the entrance of the creek and
the old entrance, Deutschman has excavated a small natural
opening to a size sufficiently large enough to admit an average
person with comfort. A small passage joins with the underground
way of the creek, and by following along its edge you
eventually come to the point of vantage previously described.
<i>En route</i>, several small chambers are passed, originally carved
out of the rock in the form of potholes by the swirl and swish
of the waters, but since much distorted in shape owing to
disintegration of the cleavage planes. The spot is unique and
wonderful, and the sensations it produces eerie in the extreme.
It is well worthy of a visit.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 id="c5"><span class="sc">Mill Bridge Series.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;On making its exit at the eastern end of Gopher Bridge,
Cougar creek pours down a narrow rock-cut for a distance of
350 feet, when it again disappears in a whirl of flying spray below
the surface of the valley. It reappears, 300 feet farther on at
the bottom of a deep gorge, having dropped 85 feet while underground.
The interval between the exit and entrance has been
named Mill bridge by the party previously mentioned, on account
of the roar of the water as it rushes underground through the
choked entrance, resembling the noise made by a big mill in
full operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rock-cut above referred to is narrow, about 8 to 10
feet wide, and of regular appearance. The upper half presents
a series of cascades and falls, and the sides show curious small
potholes that are in the process of erosion from the soft limestone.
It has been named &lsquo;The Flume,&rsquo; owing to its resemblance to a
millrace. There are several openings at the point where the
creek disappears, and its last spectacular leap as it vanishes
underground is very striking. 70 feet farther east is a
larger opening, at one time the point where the stream disappeared,
but as the rush of water cut deeper in the rock channel
it took advantage of a handy crack and gradually carved out
for itself the opening where the full volume now descends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the centre of the flume, on the eastern side, and 30
feet from it, is the entrance to the Mill Bridge series of the caves,
shown on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as &lsquo;Entrance No. 1.&rsquo; This entrance is a
mere cleft in the rock strata, and is only wide enough to admit
of the passage of a man&rsquo;s body. The total length of the underground
passageway, at one time accommodating a very considerable
volume of water, is 400 feet. The height varies from a
minimum of 10 feet to a maximum of 25 feet, and the width
from 3 to 15 feet. At its eastern end it opens to an irregularly-shaped
chamber of approximately 60 by 70 feet, with a greatest
height of 20 feet. This chamber has been named &lsquo;The Auditorium&rsquo;
by the first exploring party. Cougar creek in its flow
beneath Mill bridge passes through the Auditorium, and as it
falls 75 feet in a distance of 200 feet, from its entrance beneath
Mill bridge to the Auditorium, the chamber is replete with its
roar, and the name is appropriate, though hardly in the conventional
sense of the word. Faint daylight enters through the
passageway of the waters and serves to make the surroundings
look dim and mysterious. The frosts of winter also reach this
spot, and in the spring stalactites and stalagmites, formed of
huge icicles, are seen in columnar groups surrounding the dashing
waters and extending some distance into the chamber itself.
In this particular spot disintegration has created much havoc
and the walls no longer show the marks of water erosion, while
the floor is heaped with rock debris fallen from the ceiling. The
passageway, however, that connects it with the surface is still
intact as a sample of the power of water erosion. It is composed
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
of a series of potholes, connected one with the other by short
narrow passages. The bottom of each succeeding pothole, as
you recede from the entrance, is at a lower elevation, sometimes
as much as ten or fifteen feet. To make access possible, Deutschman
has, with the assistance of a bridge carpenter loaned by
T. Kilpatrick, superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company at Revelstoke, placed rough ladders from floor to
floor. Most of these potholes hold water in the hollows at
the bottom, and, in one case, the water is so deep&mdash;4 or 5
feet&mdash;and the potholes so wide that a floating bridge had to
be built. When it is realized that every bit of timber used in
these constructions had to be hewn from the tree and transported
on the shoulder or back, over a road hardly accessible for a
mountain goat, to the place where it was utilized, some idea
of the magnitude of the work can be formed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one spot the passageway twists in a loop, and here the
potholes are of such a curiously spiral form that it has been named
&lsquo;The Corkscrew.&rsquo; Across this bend, about 12 feet above the
main floor, a gallery extends for 120 feet. It is of a similar
pothole formation, but on a smaller scale than the main passageway.
Directly below it, at the lower end, is a peculiar sharp
spike of rock that has evidently been subsequently carved out
by water pouring from this gallery, as is readily shown by the
erosionmarks on the component rocks. In addition to the lines
of erosion on the rock spike and in the gallery pothole, honey-combing
is seen on the right and high up on the left and, still
farther on the left, spatulated markings to the depth of half an
inch, or a little over, which is a very common feature in all three
series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout the Mill Bridge series, with the exception
of the Auditorium, the floors and ceilings are of water-worn
rock, and practically no debris has fallen away pointing to the
fact that this channel is of more recent origin, and the rock
through which it has worn of a more compact stratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time it was reported that the roof of this passage
was set with sparkling quartz crystals. It turned out, however,
that they were only drops of water that had collected through
leakage or condensation. Some of the potholes are very curiously
marked by thin incrustations of carbonate of lime spreading
over their concave surfaces in florescent patterns. Overhead
in many places are seen projecting spurs that have withstood
the action of the water owing to superior hardness, or that,
through some deflection of the current, have not had the same
force brought to bear upon them. The waters of Cougar creek
are derived from the melting glaciers and snow deposits lining
the sides of the peaks enclosing the valley and, in consequence,
carry a considerable quantity of sediment, composed of very
fine rock particles. The quantity of sediment carried would,
of course, be greatest when the stream was at flood stage. This
sediment has doubtless been a factor of much importance in the
erosive power of the waters, and a residue may to-day be seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
as a very thin mud-coloured coating on the walls and floors of
the passageways, where it has been deposited by the subsiding
waters. At a very high stage of water in the creek there was
an overflow into Entrance No. 1 that made the first exploration
by W. S. Ayres and party a wet and somewhat dangerous
operation. This overflow, however, was dammed back by
Deutschman, and no further trouble has since been experienced
with it.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><span class="sc">The Gorge Series.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;As stated above, the exit of Cougar creek from Mill
bridge takes place at the bottom of a narrow crack, or gorge,
running at right angles to the general direction of the stream.
The Gorge is 300 feet in length, about 50 feet wide, and is spanned
by two natural rock bridges. The sides are composed of badly
shattered limestone. On emerging from its subterranean
course beneath Mill bridge, the creek flows through the Gorge
80 feet below the floor of the valley. At the lower or north end
is the opening that leads to the largest and most interesting of
the series of passageways forming the Nakimu Caves. The
Gorge forms a very striking feature of the external scenery, and
several places are accessible from which views may be had into
its depths that are wild and impressive in the extreme. The
opening is a dome-shaped break in the wall forming the north
end. Into this the stream tumbles with wild fury over a confusion
of huge fragments of rock piled up in the passageway. It
creates leaps and falls and a dissemination of spray that makes
the opening to the outer world, as seen from below, appear
through a luminous mist. The aperture is some thirty feet
wide and about the same height.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic8">
<img src="images/pic007.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="567" />
<p class="captionc">View from Road&mdash;Mt. Avalanche, Eagle Peak, Mt. Sir Donald.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Proceeding downwards, at the foot of the falls, the channel
resumes its normal direction of a little south of east. It is
necessary here to cross the stream, which swings northward
into lower depths, and from now on the passageways are quite
free from wet, though somewhat damp from the moistness of
the Atmosphere. At the turn of the Creek&rsquo;s direction you enter
a chamber 150 feet long, 25 feet wide and from 10 feet high at
the upper end to 30 feet at the lower end. This chamber is
dimly illuminated by the daylight from outside. It is in a bad
state of ruin, and the floor is heaped with debris thrown from
the ceiling and sides. The roof is composed of one immense
slab of rock sloping with the dip of the strata. The creek has
broken through the northeast wall nearly in the middle of the
chamber and disappears into the blackness with a dull reverberating
roar. Fifty feet beyond the creek, the passage turns
north again and it is necessary to descend a rock face of some 12
feet. On it are natural notches or footholds that would seem
as though they had been cut with a cold-chisel for the special
purpose; for persons unaccustomed to climbing, it is well to use
a rope to steady the descent at this spot. The creek is now heard
far down, welling through some rock-cut with a dull, intermittent
pounding, resembling the blows of an immense sledge-hammer.
Forty feet to the right, through a low roofed passage
about 2 feet high, you creep into the &lsquo;Dropping Cave.&rsquo; It is
about 30 by 40 feet and 6 to 10 feet high, and so named from the
fact that water drops from the roof in all directions. The floor
is composed of broken rock fragments, and the walls and ceilings
of dark blue limestone marked in places by irregular streaks of
white crystalline calcite. At the eastern end, a very narrow
passage between fallen masses of rock, affording barely room to
squeeze through, leads to &lsquo;The Witches Ball-room.&rsquo; It is 1&frac12; to
2 feet wide, 3 to 4 feet high and some 20 feet in length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ball-room is roughly triangular in shape with sides
of about 60 feet, and an estimated height of 50 feet. The largest
portion of the space is occupied by an enormous rock that has
fallen from the roof. This rock has a generally level surface,
and is just the spot where a group of witch-hags might be expected
to caper round the ghastly fumes of some hellish cauldron at a
Sabbath meeting; hence the name, in sympathy with the ill-omened
and weird surroundings. On all sides, except that of
the passage, are deep cracks partly choked up by fallen blocks
but still exposing many deep and pitch-black holes leading to
the unknown, where the underground stream is heard roaring
dully. By one of these, at the northeast corner of the chamber,
W. S. Ayres and C. H. Deutschman penetrated to &lsquo;The Terror&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Old Mill,&rsquo; the former 60 odd feet below the Ball-room.
Their explorations in this quarter are shown on the accompanying
<a href="#map1">map</a>, in red, and a description of them will be found in Mr.
Ayres&rsquo; supplementary report. Many of the fallen blocks show
crystalline calcite markings similar to those found in the Dropping
Cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving the Ball-room the passage leads southeasterly for
a distance of 125 feet to where there is a parting of the ways.
The upper end is a vaulted chamber, 15 to 20 feet wide and
about 20 feet high, a crack on the left, leading to the depths
below, has been partly filled by fallen rock debris. The broken
blocks of which the floor is composed show crystallized dark blue
limestone, veined with white ribbons of calcite. For the lower
portion, the passage lies between separated limestone strata
from 3 to 7 feet apart; the floor, of broken boulders and slabs
is very irregular. Both roof and floor are water-worn and show
erosion markings. They descend until they meet 20 to 30 feet
below. The subterranean stream is heard with a muffled roar
on the left. On the right, three passages, met at intervals, lead
to two circular funnel-like chambers, the more distant of which
has been named &lsquo;The Pit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now necessary to return to the surface and seek ingress
to the caves by means of Entrance No. 3, not far from the Gorge
on the eastern side. Entrance No. 3 is close by Lookout point
and is the first accessible opening seen on the journey up the
valley. A descent is made some 10 or 12 feet by a rough ladder,
placed by Deutschman, to a small cavern where there is just room
for three persons to crouch. Off this, a very narrow slit, through
which it is barely possible to squeeze, opens to a narrow chute.
Down this chute, by means of a rope placed around the body,
a descent can be made some 20 feet, to the brink of space.
From the final ledge a stone will drop a long way before it strikes.
The total distance from the opening to the brink of the Pit is
60 feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When surveying the Gorge series, the writer discovered
a very peculiar passage, shown on the <a href="#map1">map</a> as the &lsquo;Marbleway.&rsquo;
It was of a perfectly eroded structure, composed of a number of
small connected potholes in a dark bluish-grey limestone, shot
in every direction by ribbon streaks of white crystalline calcite.
The walls were dripping with moisture and rendered the limestone
dead black and the veins of calcite vivid white, the whole
resembling a rich glistening marble. This passage was followed
to the larger one shown on the <a href="#map1">map</a>, and that in turn to the
circular chamber named &lsquo;The Pit.&rsquo; It seemed probable that
this was the spot where stones, dropped from the ledge attained
by Entrance No. 3, first struck, so Deutschman was sent to
reconnoitre and, not long afterwards, his face could be seen
near the extreme apex of the roof peering down through the dim
halo of his tallow dip. A stone tied to a cord and subsequently
measured showed the drop to the floor of the Pit to be 120 feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chamber is about 20 feet in diameter and rises like
a gigantic funnel to something over the height named. The walls
are similar to those of the Marbleway, and some of the effects
are very peculiar, reminding the beholder of forked lightning
on a dead black background. At the bottom of the Pit was seen
a very queer slab of rock, shaped almost perfectly like a monumental
tombstone, and having directly in its centre, as though
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
carved by hand, a cross (+). The descent from the floor of the
Pit to the main passage, although slightly precipitous in one
or two places, is quite easy, the distance being 120 and 130 feet
by the main way and Marbleway, respectively. The walls of
the Pit funnel are water-worn and, at one time, a stream flowed
into it by Entrance No. 3, doubtless being the cause of the formation
of the chamber. The stream, which now only carries
off the surplus flow from the melting snows, has found another
subterranean opening and joins Cougar creek in its underground
way, somewhere beyond the Ball-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the meeting of the ways above referred to, the lower
or eastern one is named &lsquo;The Slanting Way&rsquo; from the fact that
the passage is formed by a separation of the limestone strata,
and lies across their dip. The upper passage has an arched roof
and has been named &lsquo;The Subway.&rsquo; Both are difficult to traverse:
the former on account of the broken debris and sloping rock of
which the floors are formed, and of two uncomfortably narrow
places which can be squeezed through with difficulty; the latter
on account of the close proximity of floor and ceiling and the
necessity of bending nearly double for a considerable part of
the distance while traversing it. The lower passage is the easier
of the two. The strata forming the Slanting Way are from five
to ten feet apart. The slabs of both roof and floor are water-worn
and bear spatulated erosion marks, like incipient honey-combing.
On the east, or left side, as you advance, are deep
cracks in the strata, at the bottom of whose depths Cougar
creek may be heard echoing loudly through the vaulted ways.
Stones dropped into these seem to rebound for a long time
before resting. About the centre of the Slanting Way the cracks
in the strata expand and a descent may be made to the bed of
Cougar creek below the Turbine. The Turbine is reached by
a rather difficult passage requiring some skill in climbing. The
end of the passage is an irregular opening in the rock. Across
a chasm, at whose bottom flows the main stream, a number of
water-spouts rush out with great force and a noise resembling
that produced by water falling into the pit of a turbine. For
an account of this section see Ayres&rsquo; report. Near the south
end of the Slanting Way is a curious pothole on the left-hand
side. Directly beyond it the floor and walls are covered by an
incrustation of carbonate of lime, varying in thickness from 2
to 6 inches. It is of a light creamy colour, shading off in some
places to a delicate salmon. The formation has a florescent
appearance and resembles, mostly, cauliflower heads set closely
together, a simile derived from W. S. Ayres&rsquo; report. Owing to
the beautiful floral decorations, this particular spot has been
named &lsquo;The Art Gallery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Similar decorations are found throughout the Caves,
though not so extensively as at this and a few other places. At
some, there is only a thin veneer of the carbonate formation and,
at others, rock-milk (<i>agaric mineral</i>) is seen on the floors and
boulders. The writer did not observe any stalagmites, nor any
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
stalactites worth speaking of. The longest did not exceed 15
inches, and resembled, more than anything else, a thin icicle of
that length; its chief interest being that it was clear and transparent,
as though made of ice, and as brittle as glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Subway is about 10 to 15 feet wide and from 7 to 2
feet high; the roof is arched and covered by moisture drops,
which are very unpleasant when they find their way down your
back. The floor is of broken rock, rising to a ridge along the
centre of the passageway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the meeting of the ways, just beyond the Art Gallery,
the passage continues southeasterly, ever increasing in interest.
In the next 200 feet, it varies in width from 15 to 30 feet with
a height of 10 to 15 feet. On the right is a narrow twisting
side-opening named &lsquo;The Gimlet.&rsquo; On the left are two concave
sections of old potholes, leading into the most subterranean
depths. They are profusely decorated by florescent carbonate
incrustations, the first one being named &lsquo;The Dome&rsquo; from its
perfect formation. Minor passageways lead from them at a
still greater depth. The most southerly one connects with
&lsquo;Judgment Hall,&rsquo; to be described further on (see <a href="#map1">map</a>). In
this section the underground course of Cougar creek crosses the
corridor, at a considerable depth below, and the roar of the hidden
waters is transferred from the left to the right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A narrow opening, 1&frac12; feet wide and 15 feet long, now
leads to &lsquo;Carbonate Grotto&rsquo; where are seen very fine calcium
decorations. The Cavern containing the grotto is about 60 by
30 feet, with a height varying from 10 to 15 feet. For the next
130 feet the passage varies from 8 feet wide and 5 feet high at
the upper end to 20 feet wide and 5 feet high at the lower end.
The sides are hung with rock shelves, and spotted with lime
incrustations; the bottom is much impeded by fallen blocks.
You now find yourself in a cul-de-sac and apparently at the end
of the series. Not so, however, for by squeezing through a
narrow opening on the right, barely noticeable in the darkness,
you are enabled to descend to probably the largest cavern of all,
at a depth of 57 feet below the corridor just left. The chamber,
200 feet long, 20 feet wide and 40 to 50 feet high has been named
&lsquo;Judgment Hall,&rsquo; on account of a pillar which might stand for
the pillar of justice. The floor is littered by blocks broken from
the roof and sides which lie piled in great heaps at the north end.
The roof is roughly arched, and the sides rise upwards in parallel
ledges resembling shelves. Roof, sides, and the rocks piled on
the floor, are covered by the white calcite and, in many places,
present most beautiful patterns and beds of florescent formations.
The north end is connected by a rough passage with one of the
potholes referred to below the meeting of the ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the centre of the western wall, a narrow gap leads
to a very beautiful, though small, chamber named &lsquo;The White
Grotto&rsquo; by W. S. Ayres. The carbonate decorations here are
of great beauty and delicacy. The passage in which the chamber
is found is 40 feet long, 15 feet wide and 10 feet high. The final
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
cave has been named the &lsquo;Bridal Chamber&rsquo; by W. S. Ayres,
owing to the purity of its lime draperies and the general beauty
of its floral decorations. It is small, and beyond this point
exploration has not yet been carried. The passage breaks off
in a precipice falling to a deep chasm, at the bottom of which
a subterranean stream, probably Cougar creek, may be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the farthest point to which the present survey has
been carried. It is 240 feet from the Wind crack, previously
referred to as being seen on the way up the valley, and is only
54 feet above it; it is safe to assume that there is a connection
between. The wind issuing from the crack is probably due to a
water blast caused by the subterranean stream falling into the
chasm at the end of the exploration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two other passages, or rather sets of passages,
that have not yet been mentioned, viz.: &lsquo;The Ice Cave,&rsquo; situated
above the deep entrance from the Gorge. It is reached from
the valley floor and is not of large dimensions, presenting only
one chamber of any size, which has been christened &lsquo;The
Temple.&rsquo; The series has been named the Ice Cave from the
fact that the initial passage entrance is blocked by ice all the
year round, and an entry is effected over this blockage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second set of passages are entered immediately
below the Goat falls, which pour into them until late in October,
when they become ice-bound. Last October, the writer followed
two of the passages&mdash;one for about 150 feet, the other for about
50 feet&mdash;but could get no farther without material for bridging.
The formation resembles the passage leading to the Auditorium,
but on a smaller scale, viz., a series of well formed potholes
connected one with the other. It is assumed that the flow from
the Goat falls, the big bulk of which passes through these two
channels, empties into the main waterway at the Turbine, but
its course may possibly be more direct. If it does not, however,
it is difficult to know where the water flowing in at the Turbine
comes from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is still something more than half a mile from the end
of the present exploration to the final point at which the subterranean
waters of Cougar creek are returned to the surface
bed. There may consequently be accessible passageways that
are yet undiscovered but, as the surface grade over this unknown
interior is much steeper and the subterranean creek bed is
approaching the surface, it seems probable that, if existing,
they will be found inaccessible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of W. S. Ayres having at two places within the
Gorge series reached the actual bed of the subterranean stream
would point to there being no further passages below that level.
It would, therefore, appear that the largest accessible portion
of the series is now on record. Much of the part shown in red
on the accompanying <a href="#map1">map</a> is difficult of access and dangerous
to unskilled climbers. Indeed, for that matter, there are plenty
of difficult places throughout.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h3 id="c7">Formation of the Caves.</h3>
<p>Mr. Ayres thinks that the Caves have been formed entirely
by water erosion, but Mr. Wheeler differs from him in this respect.
Mr. Ayres says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rocks in which the Cave occurs are of very hard
crystalline limestone, dipping about 30 degrees to the east. In
&lsquo;Entrance No. 1&rsquo; these beds are very thick and are made up of
alternate bands of white, mottled and grey marble. Some of
the bands are very highly impregnated with fine sharp sand,
so much so, in fact, that excellent whetstones can be made from
them.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/pic008.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="800" />
<p class="captionc">On the road 3&frac12; miles from Glacier.
<br />White Pine may be observed along the route&mdash;a very unusual spectacle in the Selkirk range of mountains.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cave has, undoubtedly, been formed entirely by water
erosion. The stream which formed it, Cougar creek, is entirely
made up of glacier and snow water, and above the cave is free
from any lime salts. Its capacity, therefore, to dissolve lime rock
when brought in contact with it, is at its maximum. The
fine grains of sharp sand, loosened from the lime rock and caught
in the swift current of the small stream that at first found its
way through a shrinkage crack of some particular bed of limestone,
have undoubtedly given the water an uncommon erosive
power, which, through the countless years of the cave&rsquo;s history,
has enabled that mountain torrent to carve out a mammoth
channel in solid marble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The absence of all stalactites and stalagmites, such as are
usually found in caves, and the presence of curiously carved
marble walls, wonderfully carved in fantastic shapes and sombre
colouring, suddenly make one realize that he is far removed from
things familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian word &ldquo;Nakimu,&rdquo; by which the Caves are
generally known, has the Anglo-Saxon equivalent of &ldquo;grumbling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This might imply that in some distant past a seismic
disturbance in the interior of the mountain resulted in its Indian
appellation, or, on the other hand, it may be due solely to the
rumbling sound of the subterranean torrent.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler, in differing from Mr. Ayres as to the factors
mainly instrumental in forming the underground channels and
caverns as seen to-day, states his conviction that an agency,
more potent and far-reaching than mere erosion and disintegration
by the ordinary processes of nature, has been at work.</p>
<p>In his arguments in this connection he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the point where Cougar creek first drops beneath
Gopher bridge, the old surface channel may be traced, though
dammed and nearly obliterated in places. If the natural
dam shown at the first point of entrance were removed, the
stream would again revert to the old entrance. Southwest of
the old entrance is a still older natural dam, whose removal
would allow the stream to proceed to the Mill bridge; thence,
following the ravine between the two camp grounds, it would
pass directly across the Gorge, supposing that great rift not yet
to exist, and flowing past &lsquo;Entrance No. 3,&rsquo; would descend in
a cataract beyond Lookout point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that these particular beds of limestone
are badly shattered in the mass. It is shown by the fact that
the surrounding streams, the Gopher falls, the periodical stream
flowing to Entrance No. 3, and that of the Goat falls all join the
main stream by underground ways. There are several other
instances where the present bed of the creek could hardly be due
to shrinkage and erosion, as in the case of the deep rift of the
Gorge lying directly across the dip of the strata (the strata dip
a little south of east, at an angle between 35 degrees and 40
degrees). The same thing is noticed in the subterranean bed
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
of the creek from the east end of the Witches Ball-room to
where it crosses the main corridor near the Art Gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From October 16 to 21, last, during the survey made of
the Gorge series by the writer, though it was well below zero at
the camp in the woods, there was no frost found in the cave
interiors at a short distance from the entrance. Thus, two of
the highest factors of disintegration, sun and frost, are lacking,
when accounting for the wholesale cleavage that has taken place
within the old waterways. The enormous size of the blocks,
moreover, and the indication that the largest of them had been
displaced a very long time ago would point to the agency of a
severe shock or series of shocks such as would be caused by an
earthquake or some similar seismic disturbance. That such
disturbances have taken place and acted in this particular locality
is borne out by other curious phenomena for which it is
difficult to find a different explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1904, Prof. W. H. Sherzer, on behalf of the Smithsonian
Institution of Washington, D.C., visited the Canadian
Rockies for the purpose of studying their glaciers. Among a
series of five, he made a special study of the Illecillewaet glacier
situated about seven and a half miles from the Caves. At some
distance from the present ice-tongue of the glacier, were found
two moraines about a third of a mile apart, composed of enormous
blocks of quartzite, weighing in some single instances as much
as 1,250 tons, and retaining the original shape in which they were
cast from the peaks above to the snow-field and glacier transporting
them to the place where they are now found. Prof.
Sherzer has named these &lsquo;Block Moraines&rsquo; in distinction to
ordinary moraines composed of ice-worn, rounded boulders
imbedded in a species of cement, commonly known as boulder
clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is: How and at what time were these block
moraines formed. At the present day the glaciers are wholly
incapable of transporting such a load, and no such quantities of
material are to be found upon the snow-field, below the peaks,
as would be necessary to form a similar moraine, even during
a protracted period of rest on the part of the glacier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the endeavor to ascertain a date for their formation,
Prof. Sherzer cut down trees growing between the two moraines
and counted the rings of growth. The oldest was found to have
an age of 550 years. Trees, also, growing on the inner or younger
moraine were measured and the age of the oldest ascertained to
be 447 years. Allowing for the time required for the collection
of sufficient soil to permit of growth taking place, the moraine,
therefore, would be between 500 and 600 years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Sherzer points to the probability of seismic
disturbances being the cause of these block moraines and that
the material of which they are formed had been shaken from the
peaks to the snow-field below. Making due allowance for the
period of transportation of the material forming the inner moraine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the earthquake would thus have occurred during the thirteenth
century. (See &lsquo;Glacial Studies in the Canadian Rockies and
Selkirks, Smithsonian Expedition of 1904,&rsquo; by William Hittell
Sherzer, Ph. D.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;That disturbances of this nature have taken place in
Canada at a much more recent date is pointed out in the above
report by the following quotation from the &lsquo;<i>Jesuite Relations</i>,&rsquo;
Thwaites translations, vol. xlvii, pp. 37-57; 183-223: &lsquo;On the
fifth of February, 1663, towards half-past five in the evening,
a loud roaring was heard at the same time throughout the
length and breadth of Canadas. . . . On level ground,
hills have arisen; mountains, on the other hand, have been
depressed and flattened. Chasms of wonderful depth, exhaling
a foul stench, have been hollowed out in many places, plains lie
open, far and wide, where there were formerly very dense and
lofty forests. Cliffs, although not quite levelled with the soil,
have been shattered and overturned.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="captionc">Government building at the Caves for the use of visitors.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the origin of block moraines can be accounted for by
seismic disturbances, it is not improbable to assume that at
some remote date a similar occurrence has shattered this bed
of crystalline limestone and precipitated Cougar creek from its
surface course into subterranean channels, which, through the
course of ages, it has enlarged to their present size, and that
subsequent shocks have been mainly responsible for the large
quantities of fallen debris that litter the interiors. Under such
a condition of affairs, the crack of the Gorge, and similar chasms
found below the surface, would be accounted for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gist of Mr. Ayres&rsquo; arguments concerning the probable
age of the cave is contained in the following paragraphs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marble rocks in which the cave is formed belong
most probably to the Devonian age. No fossils were found,
however, to positively verify this conclusion. The limestone
rocks have not been completely changed into marble at all
points as was observed under &lsquo;Gopher Bridge&rsquo; and in &lsquo;The Terror.&rsquo;
Notwithstanding the fact that the rocks belong to a comparatively
old series, yet the beginning of the cave undoubtedly
dates from a very recent geological time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuming the rate of erosion to be one thirty-second of an
inch in a year, then to cut down one hundred feet of rock, which
is about the average amount eroded in the main cave, would
require 38,400 years. Any actual rate greater or less than this
assumption would increase or diminish the age of the cave. In
several places along Cougar creek in the bottom of the cave an
excellent opportunity is afforded to determine actually the present
annual rate of erosion. A micrometer measuring apparatus
should be used and the area of cross-section of the rock eroded
per year thus accurately computed. Also the ratio between the
area of the cross-section of the average stream and the area of
the rock eroded should be determined. And finally, the quantity
of water passing the given section in one year, and its velocity,
should be accurately measured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In contemplating the foregoing suggestion as to the
probable age of the cave, it should be borne in mind that where
gravel and sand lodge in the bed of the stream the rate of erosion
is many times less than where the bed is continually swept
clean by a more rapid current.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3 id="c8">EXCURSION SUGGESTIONS.</h3>
<p>Nakimu Caves may be reached by travelling to Glacier,
in Glacier Park, B.C., on the Canadian Pacific railway, and
from that point either by walking or riding on a pony a distance
of about seven miles along excellent road and trail.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">
<img src="images/pic010.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="800" />
<p class="captionc">A pic-nic party at the Caves.</p>
</div>
<p>The distance to the Nakimu Caves from Glacier House by
way of the wagon road&mdash;Illecillewaet river and Cougar creek,
is 7 miles; by horse trail, via Rogers pass over the summit of
Baloo pass to the Caves, the distance is 3 miles farther. Baloo
pass is 6681 feet above sea-level, and from the summit is an
extensive view, including not only the Hermit range and McDonald,
but the Dawson peaks, Bishop range and the mountains
that girt Cougar valley.</p>
<p>At the Caves is a government building especially adapted
for campers, with cook stoves and other conveniences. Parties
desiring to camp can make arrangements by writing to C. H.
Deutschman, The Caves, Glacier, B.C.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>This camp is the starting point for many easy and hard rock
climbs.</p>
<p>From Cheops, whose altitude is 8,506 feet above sea-level,
but only 3,300 feet above the cabin, the view is unsurpassed,
owing to its central location. The climb takes 3&frac12; hours and,
from the top, over 200 glaciers can be counted, and on a clear
day the Rocky mountains, 150 miles away, can be seen guarding
the horizon with rugged peaks.</p>
<p>Cougar mountain (altitude, 7,882 feet, 2,500 feet above the
camp) is an easier and shorter climb of 2 hours.</p>
<p>Ursus Major, altitude, 8,930 feet; Ursus Minor, altitude,
9,026 feet; Catamount, altitude, 8,956 feet; Bagheera, altitude,
9,096 feet and many others, are within the limit of a day&rsquo;s
climb.</p>
<p>The ice caves under the Glacier at the head of Cougar valley
are also worth a visit. For botanists, this is a paradise, the alpine
and sub-alpine flowers being gorgeous and abundant, and many
rare species are found here. Over 150 species can be gathered
in a short time in July or August.</p>
<p>A two days&rsquo; camping trip may be undertaken as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>From Glacier House via Baloo pass to the Nakimu Caves,
exploring Bear creek and Cougar valleys, spending the night at
Camp, visiting &ldquo;The Caves&rdquo; and arriving at Glacier in time
for dinner the following evening.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
